INTERVIEW QUESTION:
I want you to act as an interviewer for a Data Scientist job. I will be the candidate and you will ask me an interview question for the position of Senior Data Scientist. The question is:

Discuss three ways to make your model robust to outliers?

Turn this question into a multiple choice question with 3 wrong answers and 1 correct answer being the most ideal answer for that question in the interview. For each answer, provide an explanation why it was right or wrong.  The incorrect answers should all have 3 items to match the question that is asking for 3 ways.
Put it into the following format below, changing the bool attribute ‘correct’ for the answer this is correct as true.  
For the gptQuestion map, use the questionText as the key and the Topic for the value.  
For the gptTopics map, pick out up to 3 closely related topics to the topic as the keys, and for the values use ‘general data science definition’.

// Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features or variables in a dataset while preserving its essential structure and relationships. Benefits include:
                  //
                  // 1. Noise reduction: Eliminates irrelevant or redundant features, improving model performance.
                  // 2. Computational efficiency: Reduces training time and resource requirements for machine learning algorithms.
                  // 3. Visualization: Makes it easier to visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D space.
                  // 4. Interpretability: Simplifies models, making them easier to understand and explain.
